		Before appointing a shipment, one should thoroughly look over the terms and conditions to ensure there is a clear understanding of JOF's appointing protocol.  Bookmark, print or favorite this page to have it on hand during your shipping process, should any questions arise.
  	<br>

		Most importantly, read over the definition of freight brokerage which details that the customer acknowledges that JOF is a JOF Broker and NOT a JOF Carrier. Acting as a broker between the Customer , JOF provides access to carrier rates and carrier services. Knowing this piece of information helps to avoid a lot of confusion about what JOF Brokerage does and doesn’t do. In simple terms, we never lay hands on your freight. We simply are a means of finding the best possible shipping solution for your shipment, which we accomplish through our negotiated rates, knowledgeable agents and easy to use booking process.

		Please keep in mind that the acceptance of JOF's TERMS and CONDITIONS is redundantly required in the course of booking each shipment.
