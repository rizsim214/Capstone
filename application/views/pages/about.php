  		JOF handles customs documentation processing in import and export shipment in Cebu, from local and foreign countries for years.</p>

  		All these years, JOF continued to play a big part in the country’s freight industry as the company is committed to offer the best logistics assistance, not just to private customers but also to corporate clients. Since freight forwarding isn’t a simple process, it requires complete capability to handle consignments under different shipping modes, and properly organize them with various carriers around the world. <br>
  	<br>
  		Customs brokerage equally involves skills and knowledge in particular customs information and documentation in order to smoothly facilitate the cargo’s clearance and delivery. And JOF takes pride in fulfilling these responsibilities while keeping up with the trade’s constant changes and developments.
